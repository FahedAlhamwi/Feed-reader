# Project Overview
In this project we are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Which already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) ,this application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

# How the test is going
Write the tests:
1. To make sure that the allFeeds variable has been defined and not empty.
2. To loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
3. To loops through each feed in the allFeeds object and ensures it has a name defined and that the name is not empty.
4. To ensures the menu element is hidden by default.
5. To ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
6. To ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work.
7. To ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.

# How TO run
Open index.html in the browser of your choice. Once loaded, test results should be displayed at the bottom of the page.
